                Some things in life are simply inevitable, like getting older. As we age, things begin to change in our
                lives. We learn to let things go and to smile more. We have more financial freedom to do things and see
                things that we’ve wanted to see and do for years. But on the flip side of the coin, our bodies begin to
                change, too. Breasts start to sag a little more than they did in years past. More fat starts to make
                itself known around your midsection, neck, arms, and stomach.
              </p>
              <p class="pb-4">
                Wrinkles and fine lines start to become more pronounced. In the past, we were taught to just deal with
                the signs of aging. But in modern times, there are safe, innovative ways to recapture the incomparable
                feeling of youth. If you’re getting more and more self-conscious about how you look, it could be time to
                work with a plastic surgeon in city, state, like Dr. Mark Bishara of Paragon Plastic Surgery.

                <p class="text-center">
                  The primary goal of plastic surgery is to enhance a person's physical appearance, often resulting in
                  increased self-confidence. This boost in self-esteem can lead to a range of positive emotions and
                  behaviors. A reputable plastic surgeon – like Dr. Mark Bishara – will take into account not only the
                  physical aspects but also the mental and emotional well-being of their patients when determining if
                  plastic surgery is suitable.

              Body Contouring: Lifting Loose Skin After Substantial Weight Loss

                  The obesity epidemic in the United States and worldwide has prompted numerous programs aimed at
                  reducing Body Mass Index (BMI) for individuals' well-being. However, substantial weight loss cannot
                  disregard real-world physics. As a result of weight loss, bodily components such as skin and fat
                  deposits undergo significant changes in tension and size, which may not adjust accordingly. Bariatric
                  weight loss surgery has helped many people achieve their BMI goals and lead healthier lives, but it
                  has also increased the need for body contouring following weight loss. If you made the choice to get
                  healthy and lose weight but are left with unattractive and frustrating loose skin, it could be time to
                  speak with a plastic surgeon in city, state.

          <p>
            The goal of body contouring is to remove excess skin for both cosmetic and functional reasons. Large hanging
            skin folds can be considered unappealing from an aesthetic standpoint, and frequent chafing between
            functional and excess skin can make daily activities uncomfortable, potentially leading to skin infections.
            Additionally, moisture trapped between loose skin folds can create an ideal environment for bacterial
            growth, posing hygiene issues for the patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it's feasible to perform a full body lift in one session, most doctors prefer to divide body
            contouring surgeries into multiple sessions for the patient's safety and comfort. At Paragon Plastic
            Surgery, our body contouring procedures are split up into a few of the most common areas on which we
            operate, including:

                    Having performed hundreds of breast augmentation surgeries, Dr. Bishara and his team know that every
                    woman is different. Your neighbor down the street won’t have the same needs and desires with their
                    breast lifts as you. That’s why we’re committed to pre-operative consultations to understand what
                    you’d like to gain from your breast augmentation surgery and determine the most suitable implant
                    type and placement. This ensures that you and every patient who walks through our doors receive
                    personalized, professional treatment.

                In today’s day and age, aesthetic impressions matter more than at any other time in history. Whether
                we’re meeting a new person or reconvening with an old friend, one of the first places we look is at
                their face. When a person has sunken cheeks, deep wrinkles, and drooping foreheads, we tend to think
                they’re angry or disheveled. If you’re worried about unattractive features on your face that affect your
                daily life, you’re not alone. Millions of men and women around the U.S. aren’t happy with features like
                thin lips and frown lines.

            Hair loss can be caused by side effects from medication, aging, genetics, or scalp injuries with scarring.
            It affects both men and women of all ages, leading to pattern baldness, patchy spots, or thinning hair. Many
            people find this change in their appearance distressing and are frustrated by the lack of effective
            treatments. Thankfully, there are several minimally invasive and affordable treatments available to promote
            hair growth or restore hair loss. These treatments can help patients regain confidence as they enjoy thick,
            full, and beautiful hair once again.

                  The Xtrallux Extreme RX Hair Regrowth Laser Cap utilizes a unique form of laser light proven to
                  enhance circulation and trigger cellular metabolism in and around the scalp's hair follicles. Unlike
                  the lasers employed for cosmetic skin procedures and tattoo removal, the Xtrallux doesn't cause any
                  damage to the skin cells. Instead, it employs low-level, cool-to-the-touch lasers for hair
                  restoration.

                  Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) Therapy involves extracting a small amount of your blood and separating the
                  platelets and plasma. After being combined in a centrifuge, the mix is then injected just under your
                  scalp in the areas where hair growth is desired. Researchers suggest that the hormones and growth
                  factors in platelet-rich plasma play a crucial role in stimulating renewed hair growth and
                  transforming thin hair into thicker, fuller strands.

                  Many men and women choose non-surgical hair restoration because it’s minimally invasive. However, if
                  you have severe hair loss or you have tried other procedures with no luck, it might be time to see a
                  plastic surgeon in city, state. Surgical hair restoration procedures are specifically designed to
